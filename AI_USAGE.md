# AI Tool Usage Disclosure

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** for:
  - Brainstorming the initial project structure
  - Drafting boilerplate documentation (README layout, file structure)
  - High-level code architecture suggestions

## Significant Contributions
1. **Repository Structure**
   - Initial suggestion for folder layout (`src/`, `tests/`, `notebooks/`, `results/`).
   - I maintain and adapt this structure as the project evolves.

2. **Documentation Boilerplate**
   - Draft versions of `README.md` and `AI_USAGE.md`.
   - All text is reviewed, edited, and validated by me.

## What Is *Not* AI-Generated
- All final data preprocessing logic
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation code
- Experiment design and feature selection
- Interpretation of results (SHAP, crisis signals)
- The full written technical report
- Presentation slides and recorded explanation

## Integrity Statement
I understand all code and decisions in this project and I am able to explain them
during the presentation and code walkthrough.
